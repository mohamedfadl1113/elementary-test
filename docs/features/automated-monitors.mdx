<Snippet file="cloud/cloud-feature-tag.mdx" />

Elementary offers out-of-the-box automated monitors to detect freshness, volume and schema issues. 
This provides broad coverage and a basic level of observability, without any configuration effort.

Additionally, these monitors will not increase compute costs as they leverage only warehouse metadata (information schema, query history). 
 
The monitors are trained on historical metadata, and adjust based on updates frequency, seasonality and trends.

<Info>As views are stateless, automated volume and freshness monitors only apply on tables.</Info>

The monitor alerts you if there is an unexpected drop or spike in rows.
